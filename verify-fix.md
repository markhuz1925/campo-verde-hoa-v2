# Verification Steps for Route "/" Fix

## Current Changes Made

1. **Simplified Index Route**: Removed complex `beforeLoad` logic and moved redirect logic to component-level `useEffect`
2. **Enhanced AuthContext**: Added immediate resolution for missing Supabase config and reduced timeout to 2 seconds
3. **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs will show exactly what's happening with auth state

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser to `http://localhost:5173/`**

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - You should see the loading spinner with debug info showing:
     - `Loading: Yes` (initially)
     - `Authenticated: No`
     - `User: None`
   - Within 2 seconds maximum, it should redirect to `/sign-in`

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for messages like:
     - `"Supabase not configured - using mock auth (not authenticated)"`
     - `"[IndexComponent] Auth state changed:"`
     - `"[IndexComponent] Redirecting to /sign-in"`

## Key Fixes Applied

- **Immediate config check**: If Supabase env vars are missing, immediately set as not authenticated
- **Component-level navigation**: Using `useNavigate` in useEffect instead of route-level redirects
- **Reduced timeout**: From 5 seconds to 2 seconds for faster feedback
- **Better error handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms to prevent infinite loading

## If Still Stuck

If you're still seeing infinite loading:

1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify the console logs** match the expected pattern above
3. **Try hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to clear any cached state
4. **Check Network tab** in browser dev tools for any failing requests

The key improvement is that now the loading state MUST resolve within 2 seconds, either through:
1. Successful auth check
2. Failed auth check 
3. Timeout fallback
4. Missing config fallback
